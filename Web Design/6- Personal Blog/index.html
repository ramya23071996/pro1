                <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at IIM Shillong.

Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, he was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. <br><br> His purported last words to his aide Srijan Pal Singh were: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</p>
